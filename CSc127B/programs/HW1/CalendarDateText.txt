Homework #1 - Calendar Date
Instructor: Patrick Homer
TA: Nathaniel Hendrix
Due Date: 9/2/2016


The program was written in order to make an object with a month value, day 
value, and year value, which would be stored as a CalendarDate object. Next,
the date would have gone through a mutator method, allowing it to fit under 
several parameters that could have altered the values in the month, day, and 
year variables. This was done through several if statements for each of the 
parameters.There were getter methods for the day, month and year ints, and there was a 
method to return the month as a string in order to have the month int's name 
produced when called. This was again done through several if statements. A toString 
method allowed for each of the day and year ints and the month as a string to 
be returned as one singular string for other objects. A boolean equals method 
checked to see if an "otherDate" object and the defined parameters returned the 
same date (used to see if there wrre any bugs in coding). And finally, a tomorrow 
method was written, so when it was called, allowed for the given date parameters 
to return a date that was one day after the given parameters. This was done 
through extensive if statements accounting for every case of changing days, 
months, and years.

I used JDE 8.0_91, wrote the program through Dr. Java, and was on a Windows
10 laptop. To test this program, the CalendarDate class must be in the same 
folder as that testable program.

No known bugs exist, as I have extensively tested and gone to TAs for 
help, but pardon if the code is messy. As I took 127A elsewhere, I was 
not at all familar with much of Java, classes, objects, and methods, 
so this code is my attempt at learning all of these. Whew.
