Homework #11 - Binary Trees
Instructor: Patrick Homer
TA: Nathaniel Hendrix
Due Date: 12/2/2016



This collection of classes was written in order to demonstrate my ability to decode prefix codes and create a binary tree.

There are two programs that I included. The first, Binary Node, was a generic Binary Node class that I created. It really wasn't special or specific to the program at all.
Program 11 accepts a file name input, which has preorder and inorder traversals of a bianry tree. It then contructs a binary tree from those, and outputted a post rder traversal of the tree/ Finally, the progrsam uses a decoding string to travrse that tree and print out leaves any time it encountered one. 


I used JDE 8.0_91, wrote the program through Eclipse, and was on a Windows 10 laptop. To test this program, a test file with preorder and inorder traversal must be in the same folder as the classes.

No known bugs, program looks great. I hope.

Last program oh my gooooooooooooooooooooooood
