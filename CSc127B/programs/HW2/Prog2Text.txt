Homework #2 - Word Count
Instructor: Patrick Homer
TA: Nathaniel Hendrix
Due Date: 9/29/2016

The program was written in order to either accept a file input through the 
commannd line or through the main method's readLine() method. Next, the
Count method is called, and that counts the number of lines, characters, 
and words that each of the input files have. This is done through an 
intricate series of decision loops and booleans that increment the counts
for the lines, words, and characters under specific parameters. The program
then prints these values in a for loop for each text file, and the total
amounts of these are displayed.

I used JDE 8.0_91, wrote the program through Dr. Java, and was on a Windows
10 laptop. To test this program, whatever text files needed for testing
must be in the same folder as Prog2.

No known bugs exist, as I have extensively tested and gone to TAs for 
help. I had a bit of trouble with the line characters and word count
portions of the assignment, but hopefully I ironed those out. I tested
this program extensively, so I believe the conditions are well set.
