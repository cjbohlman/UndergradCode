Homework #3 - Binary Number
Instructor: Patrick Homer
TA: Nathaniel Hendrix
Due Date: 9/16/2016


The program was written in order to make an binary number object, and then 
testing said object with variuos methods. These methods include setValue, 
which makes the binaryNumber fall under a certain set of parameters, 
toString, which outputs the object as a string, equals, which checks to 
see if the obect and another created objects are equal, regardless of 
leading zeroes, incrementBy, which increments the object by another 
binaryNumber value, and decrementBy, which decrements the binary number 
object by another value. Many exceptions exist in the binary number object,
so hopefully, Arithmetic and Illegal Argument exceptions will be caught.

I used JDE 8.0_91, wrote the program through Dr. Java, and was on a Windows
10 laptop. To test this program, the BinaryNumber class must be in the same 
folder as Program3.

No known bugs exist, as I spent much time writing this. However, bugs 
probably do exist for end cases. And for that, I am sorry. I've gone to 
tutoring for about 10 hours this week cumulatively to finish this god
damn program. I hope it's up to standard.
