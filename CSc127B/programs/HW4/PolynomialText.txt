Homework #4 - Polynomial
Instructor: Patrick Homer
TA: Nathaniel Hendrix
Due Date: 9/23/2016


The program was written in order to make a Polynomial object that was 
made up of an array of term objects, and each term object had an exponent and coefficient. 
The Polynomial class had many methods, including:
one that added a term based off of a coefficient and exponent argument
one that sorted terms
one that replicate the polynomial object into a new object
one that made all positive coefficients negative or all negative coefficients positive
one that compared the equality of two polynomial objects
one that added a polynomial object into another object
one that checked if the array was full
one that checked if the array was empty
one that returned how many terms with nonzero coefficients there were
one that multipled each coefficient with scalar s
one that return the coeffcient of whatever term had exponent e
one that evaluated the polynomial with a given number
one that returned the polynomial object as a string
These methods all helped to edit the data and provide a through look at arrays of objects.

I used JDE 8.0_91, wrote the program through Dr. Java, and was on a Windows
10 laptop. To test this program, the Polynomial and Term class must be in the same 
folder as Program4.

No known bugs exist, as I spent much time writing this. However, edge cases are
probably going to mess me up again, which is unfortunate, as I think I have more than enough
tests to test everything.
