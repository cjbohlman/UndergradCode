Homework #8 - FARO SHUFFLING IS THE LITERAL DEVIL
Instructor: Patrick Homer

***TURNED IN ONE DAY LATE***


This collection of classes was written in order to generate aand modify a deck based off of 
a given file.
The classes include the Deck, Card, and Node classes

Initially, a program is given a text file and told to make a deck with that. The Deck 
class takes care of that, and offers two types of deck making constructors: an as-is deck with
string input, or an ordered deck with StringBuilder input. The decks are in reality linked 
lists, and the nodes for each of the list's items are made up of cards (with a rank and suit, 
detailed in Card class), and the nodes each link to each other as well.

Now, the deck can be shuffled in two ways, outShuffle or inShuffle. Both are called in the 
deck class, and both modify the current object, and they do not return a new object.

However, the outShuffle and inShuffle methods both create their decks by creating a new deck 
object, splitting the deck in half and butting the back half in said new object, and inserting 
each of those into the current object as they saw fit.

Calling the two string methods on any Card object or Deck object returns their representation 
as a string.

I used JDE 8.0_91, wrote the program through Eclipse, and was on a Windows
10 laptop. To test this program, all submitted classes must be in the same folder as each 
other.

No known bugs exist, as I tried to extensively test. However, the stringbuilder constructor 
was difficult to write for me, as sorting the cards took awhile to program. Therefore, it
may be bugged, by I didn't see anything wrong with it.

This was difficult. It's 12:28 AM. I'm tired.
