To use the test cases:
Copy the following:
    BookListClient.java
    test01.txt
    test01.commands
    test02.txt
    test02.commands


To run a test case, use either of the following:
    java BookListClient 01
or
    java BookListClient
then when prompted, enter: 01

If using the A01 test cases (which include authors), use A01 rather
than 01

The files:
   test01Results.txt
   testA01Results.txt
contain the answer produced by Dr. Homer's solution for each test
case.  Since you can arrange the authors for each book in any order,
you may have a different order than Dr. Homer. As long as you have
the same authors, it is okay if the order does not match.
