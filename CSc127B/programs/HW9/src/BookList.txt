Homework #8 - BookList
Instructor: Patrick Homer
TA: Nathaniel Hendrix
Due Date: 11/4/2016



This collection of classes was written in order to generate and modify a list of book titles 
and the respective authors, if there are any.
The classes include the BookList, ALinkedList, Book, and LinkNode classes

Initially, a program is given a text file and told to make a booklist with that. For every 
book object that is imported into the program, a LinkNode is made that holds a Book object, 
and the Book object is set a title and has the authors set. The books are arranged in order by 
title. If there are any authors, they are arranged in order (alphabetically) as well. They are 
all sorted into a linked list from the ALinkedList class.

From there, there are several methods used to modify the linked list. You can find a certain 
element in the linked list, remove a certain element, and insert an element in the linked list.
Finally, there are options to output the entire linked list as a string, either with titles 
only or with titles and authors.

The linked list as a whole is based off of the made-with-generics ALinkedList class, which 
holds nodes from the LinkNdes class, which hold books from the Book class, which hold
titles and authors.

I used JDE 8.0_91, wrote the program through Eclipse, and was on a Windows
10 laptop. To test this program, all submitted classes must be in the same folder as each 
other.

I hope there aren't any bugs in this system. None known, but if there are, it probably comes 
from my confusion with generics. Because I'm pretty confused with generics.
And this program had a lot of them.
