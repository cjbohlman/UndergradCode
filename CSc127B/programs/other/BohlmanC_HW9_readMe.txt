Problem #1:
The subsequent orbit of the tangential kick orbit turned out to be ___.It looks like the 
circular orbit increased on the left side with the tangential kick. In terms of total energy, 
it was _____. Similarily, the total angular momentum was _____.


Problem #2:
The subsequent orbit of the radial kick orbit turned out to be ___.It looks like the 
circular orbit shifted upwards after the kick. In terms of total energy, 
it was _____. Similarily, the total angular momentum was _____.


Problem #3:
The kick that had the most effect on the orbit was definitely the tangential kick. This 
kick extended the enture left side of the orbit outward, instead of just shifting the 
orbit, as the radial kick did. Therefore, it seems fit to say that because the tangential
kick had more of an effect because energy and angular momentum were not conserved and were
increased. This is in contrast to the radial kick, which had both energy and angular
momentum conserved.


Problem #4:
The subsequent orbit of the radial kick orbit turned out to be ___.It looks like the 
circular orbit shifted upwards after the kick. In terms of total energy, 
it was _____. Similarily, the total angular momentum was _____.

Problem #5:
The subsequent orbit of the radial kick orbit turned out to be ___.It looks like the 
circular orbit shifted upwards after the kick. In terms of total energy, 
it was _____. Similarily, the total angular momentum was _____. In terms of handling 
integration, _______.
