Homework #5 - PolynomialA and PolynomialB
Instructor: Patrick Homer
TA: Nathaniel Hendrix
Due Date: 9/30/2016


The program was written in order to make a Polynomial object that was 
made up of an ArrayList of Terms and a LinkedList of terms and each term object had an 
exponent and coefficient. 
Both the PolynomialA and B classes had many methods, including:
one that added a term based off of a coefficient and exponent argument
one that sorted terms based off of the bubble sort algorithm
one that replicate the polynomial object into a new object
one that made all positive coefficients negative or all negative coefficients positive
one that compared the equality of two polynomial objects
one that added a polynomial object into another object
one that checked if the array was full
one that checked if the array was empty
one that returned how many terms with nonzero coefficients there were
one that multipled each coefficient with scalar s
one that return the coeffcient of whatever term had exponent e
one that evaluated the polynomial with a given number
one that returned the polynomial object as a string
one that returned an ArrayList/LinkedList of all the exponents in each of the term objects
These methods all helped to edit the data and provide a through look at arrays of objects.

I used JDE 8.0_91, wrote the program through Eclipse (woo first time), and was on a Windows
10 laptop. To test this program, the PolynomialA and B programs, the Quanitity interface, and 
the Term class must be in the same folder as either program 5A or 5B.

No known bugs exist. I debugged the crap out of this program. It's much more improved now, 
especially the two Polynomial programs.
